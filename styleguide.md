# RULES 
1. Stick to PEP-8 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
2. Use `snake_case` for functions, methods and variables. Do not use `camelCase` or `PascalCase` unless it's a class name, then use `PascalCase`.
3. Branch names should always be in `train-case`. Do not use `snake_case`, `camelCase` or `PascalCase`.
4. Use `Black Formatter` to format the code.
5. Don't write useless comments. If the comment doesn't have a good reason to be there, just remove it.
6. Do NOT under ANY circumstances commit directly to the master branch.
7. Do not show off! I get it, you just learned tuple assignment, that's great, but don't overdo it.
8. Strong typing for functions and methods.

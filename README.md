# Game Idea
- The idea with the game is to make a Space Shooter game. There will be a player with a fixed position at the bottom of the screen who will encounter cycles of astroids and enemies. When the player reaches a fixed number of points a boss character will appear.

# How to run?
1. Make sure to have Python installed. If you're on Windows this is easiest acchieved by opening PowerShell and running `winget install --id Python.Python.3.14 -e --source winget`. If you're on Linux it's most likley pre-installed and if you're on Mac it's easiest acchieved with Homebrew `brew install python@3.14`. For Linux, Python is most likley already installed but if not installation will depend on your distro, `sudo apt(-get) install python3.14` is fairly standard.

2. Make sure to have GIT installed. If you're on Windows this is easiest acchieved by opening PowerShell and running `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`. If you're on Linux it's most likley pre-installed and if you're on Mac it's easiest acchieved with Homebrew `brew install git`. For Linux, Python is most likley already installed but if not installation will depend on your distro, `sudo apt(-get) install git` is fairly standard.

3. When Python and GIT are installed run `git clone https://github.com/hugolindfors/dt502g-project dt502g-project`.

4. Then run `py main.py` if on Windows else run `python3 main.py` if on macOS or Linux.

# Game Idea
-- The idea with the game is to make a Space Shooter game. There will be a player with a fixed position at the bottom of the screen who will encounter cycles of astroids and enemies. When the player reaches a fixed number of points a boss character will appear.

# How to run?
-- Make sure to have Python installed. If you're on Windows this is easiest acchieved by opening PowerShell and running `WinGet Install Python.Python.3.12`. If you're on Linux it's most likley pre-installed and if you're on Mac it's easiest acchieved with Homebrew.
